# Standalone App Validation Checklist
## File: 21072025 IHACPA Review of ALL existing PYTHON Packages_updated.xlsx

### Doug's Requirements Verification Checklist

Please manually verify these critical items in the standalone app output:

#### 1. üî¥ CRITICAL: SQLAlchemy 1.4.39 Check
**Location**: Around row 419 (Package name in column B)

**Check for**:
- [ ] SNYK URL present (Column S): Should be `https://security.snyk.io/package/pip/sqlalchemy`
- [ ] SNYK Result (Column T): Must show "Vulnerabilities found" with "HIGH" severity
- [ ] Should list CVEs (CVE-2023-30608, etc.)
- [ ] Should NOT say "None found" or "Package version not listed"

**Doug's Expected Result**: 
"SNYK Analysis: FOUND - SQLAlchemy 1.4.39 is affected by known vulnerabilities in the SNYK database, including issues of HIGH severity"

---

#### 2. ‚úÖ SNYK URL Format Verification
**Requirement**: All URLs must follow format `https://security.snyk.io/package/pip/<package_name>`

**Random Sample Check** (Check 10 random packages):
- [ ] Row 10: URL format correct?
- [ ] Row 50: URL format correct?
- [ ] Row 100: URL format correct?
- [ ] Row 150: URL format correct?
- [ ] Row 200: URL format correct?
- [ ] Row 250: URL format correct?
- [ ] Row 300: URL format correct?
- [ ] Row 350: URL format correct?
- [ ] Row 400: URL format correct?
- [ ] Row 450: URL format correct?

---

#### 3. ‚ùå Error Message Check
**Requirement**: NO instances of "Package version not listed"

**Search Column T (SNYK Result) for**:
- [ ] Zero occurrences of "Package version not listed"
- [ ] All packages have either:
  - "Vulnerabilities found..." with details
  - "None found" (after checking SNYK)
  - Specific error message if package not in SNYK database

---

#### 4. üìä Data Quality Spot Checks

**High-Risk Packages to Verify** (These should show vulnerabilities):
- [ ] **aiohttp 3.8.3**: Should show HIGH severity vulnerabilities
- [ ] **boto 2.49.0**: Should show vulnerabilities
- [ ] **botocore 1.27.59**: Should show vulnerabilities
- [ ] **requests** (any version < 2.31.0): Should show vulnerabilities

**Format of Good SNYK Result**:
```
Vulnerabilities found in v[VERSION] (Severity: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW, 
CVEs: CVE-XXXX-XXXXX, CVE-YYYY-YYYYY, ...). 
Latest safe version: X.X.X available - consider upgrade.
```

- [ ] Total packages analyzed: ______
- [ ] Packages with SNYK URLs: ______
- [ ] Packages with valid SNYK results: ______
- [ ] Packages showing vulnerabilities: ______
- [ ] Packages showing "None found": ______
- [ ] Any error messages: ______

---

### 6. üìã Comparison with Doug's Manual Review

For a sample of 20 packages, compare your results with Doug's (Column Y in his file):
- [ ] How many match exactly? ___/20
- [ ] How many have same vulnerability assessment (found/not found)? ___/20
- [ ] List any significant discrepancies:
  - Package: __________ Your result: __________ Doug's: __________
  - Package: __________ Your result: __________ Doug's: __________

---

### Final Assessment

Based on your manual verification:

**Does the standalone app output meet Doug's requirements?**
- [ ] YES - All requirements met, including SQLAlchemy 1.4.39
- [ ] NO - Issues found (list below)

**Issues to fix (if any)**:

### Email to Doug - Only send if ALL checks pass:

"Hi Doug,

I'm pleased to report that our standalone automation tool has been successfully updated to address all the issues you identified. The attached spreadsheet (21072025 IHACPA Review of ALL existing PYTHON Packages_updated.xlsx) now correctly:

1. **Identifies SQLAlchemy 1.4.39 vulnerabilities** - Shows HIGH severity with all CVEs listed
2. **Generates proper SNYK URLs** - All in the format you specified
3. **Eliminates generic errors** - No more "Package version not listed" messages
4. **Provides detailed vulnerability data** - CVEs, severity levels, and upgrade recommendations

The automation now produces results that align with your manual review findings. Thank you for your patience and detailed feedback - it was invaluable in improving our security assessment process.

Best regards,
Sean"

**‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT SEND if SQLAlchemy 1.4.39 still shows "None found"!**
